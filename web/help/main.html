        Welcome to 'Carracci', a tool for creating and editing UML class diagrams.
    </p>

    <h4>How to use Carracci to create UML Class diagrams</h4>
    <p>Use the editor to create and edit things by typing in commands and pressing enter. A full list of available commands is given below. Also edit diagrams by clicking and dragging objects around. Some functionality is also provided through keyboard shortcuts.</p>

    <p>The following is a quick tutorial illustrating a typical workflow</p>

    <p>create a diagram called 'foo' and navigate to diagram context:   </p>

    <p>create diagram foo</p>

    <p>use diagram foo</p>

    <p>
        Carracci maintains a 'context path' through the diagram which allows you to navigate through a  diagram and execute commands which operate on its parts. For example, after creating a diagram, in order to create components within it it is necessary to use the 'use diagram' command as shown above to enter its context.
    </p>

    <p>Create a few type boxes</p>

    create type Bar
    create type Blah

    <p>create a horizontal connector</p>

    create connector horizontal

    <p>click and drag on components to move them around. If the editor is in the way, use 'min' command to minimize the editor. Restore it back to its original size with 'max'</p>


    <h4>Using the command editor</h4>
    <p>type in commands at the cursor and press return. Valid commands are detailed below.</p>
    <h3>Commands for working with command editor</h3>
    <p>Listed, are commands for setting various properties for the editor environent, for

    <ul>
        <li>min : minimize this editor</li>
        <li>max : maximize this editor</li>
        <li>width WIDTH : set width of editor e.g. width 400</li>
        <li>height HEIGHT : set height of editor e.g. height 200</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Commands for creating and editing diagrams</h3>

    <h4>load</h4>

    <p>e.g.: load commandPattern</p>

    <h4>Existing diagrams. </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>commandPattern</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>create</h4>
    <p>general command for creating artifacts e.g diagrams, boxes, connectors etc.</p>

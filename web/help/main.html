            Welcome to 'Carracci', a tool for creating and editing UML class diagrams. Create and edit
            diagrams using this command terminal, and by dragging and dropping objects within the gui.
            It is also possible to export your diagram to PNG format.

            <p>
                Carracci is a tool for creating UML class diagrams through a combination of
                inputting commands through this terminal, dragging and dropping objects within the gui
                diagram, and with a small number of keyboard shortcuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full details of available commands are given below in the 'Commands' chapter,
                but this chapter aims to provide a short walk-through guide which demonstrates
                the main functionalities.
            </p>

            <h2>Basic Environment</h2>
            <p>
                When you first open the application, the first thing you will see is the command
                terminal sitting in an otherwise empty screen.
                As you probably already realise if you are reading this, the editor functions more
                or less as a typical command line terminal; input commands by
                typing them at the cursor and pressing return. There is little more to this terminal
                than this, and do not expect it to provide any of the advanced functionality
                present in Bash and other terminals.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a limited set of commands which allow for resizing the terminal.
                Once again, full details and syntax are given in the commands chapter,
                but here is a typical workflow:
            </p>
            <div class="first-indent">
                <p>type 'clear' and press 'return' to remove the contents of the terminal.</p>
                <p>type 'width 500' and press 'return'  to set the width of the terminal to 500 pixels.</p>
                <p>type 'height 200' and press 'return' to set the height of the terminal to 200 pixels.</p>
                <p>type 'max' and press 'return' to set the terminal to default maximum dimensions.</p>
                <p>type 'min' and press 'return' to set the terminal to default minimum dimensions.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The rest of the screen space apart from the terminal is entirely given up for displaying the diagram.
            </p>
            <h2>Creating objects in the editor</h2>
            <p>
                First, some definitions: This manual uses the word 'object' simply to refer to 'things'
                within the diagram, and the diagram itself. For example, a class box is an object.
                A connector arrow is an object.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 'create' command is used to create objects. The first argument to it is the type of object
                to create. The second argument is the name to give to the object.
                To create a diagram called 'fooDiagram':
            </p>
            <pre>
                create diagram fooDiagram
            </pre>

            <p>
                You will see a message telling you what you have just done, but you wont see anything
                else because whilst you have created a diagram, you haven't put anything into it.
                Use the 'show' command to display the json representation of the current diagram
            </p>
            <pre>
                show
            </pre>
            <p>
                This should print out to the terminal something like the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
                {
                  "diagrams": {
                    "fooDiagram": {
                      "types": {},
                      "connectors": {}
                    }
                  }
                }
            </pre>

            <p>
                Carracci stores diagrams internally as json objects. You do not need to edit these,
                but it may be useful to you at times to inspect them just to
                see what is going on. It is also useful, as we will shortly see, to think of the diagram
                as a tree like object.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, this json object contains a diagram object, and within this is the 'fooDiagram'
                object that you just created. There are two place holder properties 'types' and 'connectors' whose
                meaning is hopefully self explanatory. 'types' will contains types, and 'connectors'
                will contain connectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the create command to create types and connectors, but before we do this,
                there is one other command which we need to run: the 'use' command
            </p>
            <pre>
                use diagram fooDiagram
            </pre>
            <p>
                Because the diagram is represented by Carracci as a tree like structure of objects,
                in order to work with any particular object it is necessary to be at the right
                location within the tree. The 'use' command is used to navigate through the tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                The position we are in within the diagram tree at any particular time is called the 'context'.
                You can find out the current context at any time by typing 'con'. This will print out:
            </p>


            <pre>
                diagram fooDiagram
            </pre>
            <p>
                What this means is that we are at the level of a diagram object called 'fooDiagram'. This means
                that we can create objects which exist at this level. From the json above you can see that this
                is the context in which we can create types and connectors: so lets do that:
            </p>
            <pre>
                create type Bar
            </pre>

            <p>
                Now you should see a type box visible within the canvas. Providing it's not
                underneath the terminal, you can click on it and drag it around to whatever
                position you like.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type box still has it's default properties however, and you probably want to change these. In
                order to be able to work with the type box properties, we need to be in the context of the type.
            </p>

            <pre>
                use type Bar
            </pre>
            <p>
                There are 3 kinds of things which you can set on a type box: It's 'flavour', that is
                whether it represents an 'Abstract Class', a 'Class' or an 'Interface'; properties, and methods.
                To set the type box be an Abstract class.
            </p>

            <pre>
               set flavor abstract
            </pre>
            <p>
                Lets remove the existing property 'testProp' which we don't need:
            </p>
            <pre>
                remove property testProp
            </pre>

            <p>
                create property called 'ourProperty'.
            </p>
            <pre>
                create property ourProperty
            </pre>

            <p>
                In order to change the visibility of the property and its type, you must navigate into
                its context
            </p>
            <pre>
                use property ourProperty
            </pre>

            <p>change the visibility to 'public'</p>
            <pre>
                set visibility public
            </pre>
            <p>
                set the property type to 'String'
            </p>

            <pre>
                set type String
            </pre>

            <p>
                At this point, we have created a class box, changed its flavor to be an Abstract Class,
                deleted a default property, created our own property, and made alterations to that property.
                The next stage might be to work with methods. The problem however is that in terms of context
                we are at the very edge of the tree.We need to be able to travel back up the tree to be able to work
                with other parts of the diagram.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can navigate back up the tree with the use command. this form of the command takes as an argument
                just the type of a containing object and navigates to that context.  For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                use type
            </pre>
            <p>Will change the context from the current property context into the context for the containing type. similarily: </p>
            <pre>
                use diagram
            </pre>
            <p>Will navigate to the diagram context.</p>

            <h2>Working with methods</h2>
            <p>
                Let's assume that you have navigated to the context of our abstract type. We now want to add some methods

            </p>

            <pre>
                create method doThis
            </pre>
            <p>
                A method is a bit more complicated than a property. It has zero or more arguments as well as a
                visibility and a return Type. we can however set all of these through the command terminal.
                Firstly, lets get into context of the doThis method.
            </p>
            <pre>
                use method doThis
            </pre>
            <p>
                Setting the visibility is exactly the same as setting it for a property. Setting
                return type for a method is exactly the same as setting type for a property.
            </p>
            <h2>method arguments</h2>
            <p>
                create arguments when in method context using create command passing in as arguments
                the term 'arg' plus the argument name and type as second and third arguments.
            </p>
            <pre>
                create arg myArg Integer
            </pre>
            <p>
                remove arguments
            </p>
            <pre>
                remove arg myArg
            </pre>
            <h2>
                Working with connectors
            </h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have a box and have edited it to our satisfaction, the next thing that
                we would want to do is to show the relationships between boxes using connector arrows.
                This is not an UML tutorial, so I wont discuss the rules concerning connector arrows in UML, suffice
                to say that all connector types are supported in Carracci.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Carracci (not in UML) a connector can have one of two orientations-horizontal or vertical, and though
                these can be moved around, stretched and switched directions, this basic orientation cannot change.
                To create a connector with a horizontal orientation we must be in diagram context (use diagram) then enter                the command
            </p>


            <pre>
                create connector horizontal
            </pre>

            <p>
                Not surprisingly, the command to create vertical oriented connectors is identical except that the
                argument 'horizontal' is replaced with 'vertical'.
            </p>
            <h2>Removing connectors</h2>
            <p>
                The way of removing connectors is admittedly not optimal at the moment. As an object, a connector
                is identified by name and so is deleted by name. Connector names can be found by inspecting
                the diagram json produced by running the 'show' command. Unfortunately, it's not clear
                which connector is which. Connectors are given a unique name which consists of a
                prefix and a number corresponding to the order in which it was created.
                e.g. abc1 for the first connector, abc2 for the second etc. A connector
                can thus be deleted like so:
            </p>

            <pre>
                remove connector abc1
            </pre>

            <h2>Working with connectors</h2>
            <p>
                At this point, the tutorial shifts gear from the command line to the interactive diagram.
                As will be obvious from playing around with the various objects, they can be dragged
                around easily round the screen. Connectors can be moved by dragging at the ends and
                corner points of them.
            </p>
            <h2>Connecting connectors to boxes</h2>

            <p>
                Hold down shift key and click first on an arrow node, then on the box to which you
                wish to attach it.
            </p>
            <h2>Disconnect connector from box</h2>
            <p>
                Hold down shift and click on an arrow node. arrow node will no longer
                be connected, although it will remain in position beside the box
                until you move it manually
            </p>
            <h2>Change line style</h2>
            <p>
                Toggle line style between dashed and solid by holding down control
                whilst clicking on a connector node
            </p>
            <h2>Change arrow type</h2>
            <p>Ctrl + shift and click on arrow node to change through the different available types</p>
            <h2>exporting a diagram</h2>
            <p>
                You should now have enough information to construct a complete uml diagram.
                Once completed, you probably want to save it in some form. Carracci
                allows you do this by exporting it to png format.
            </p>
            <pre>
                export png
            </pre>
            <p>
                A new window will open up containing the generated png which you can
                then save to disk
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                And so ends our short tutorial. You can now create complex UML class diagrams and
                export them to PNG format.
                <br/>
                Happy drawing!

        <h1 class="chapter-heading">Annibale Carracci</h1>
        <img id ="self-portrait-annibale" src="images/Annibale_Carracci_Self-portrait.jpg"/>

        Annibale Carracci was born in Bologna, and in all likelihood was first apprenticed within his family. In 1582, Annibale, his brother Agostino and his cousin Ludovico Carracci opened a painters' studio, initially called by some the Academy of the Desiderosi (desirous of fame and learning) and subsequently the Incamminati (progressives; literally "of those opening a new way"). While the Carraccis laid emphasis on the typically Florentine linear draftsmanship, as exemplified by Raphael and Andrea del Sarto, their interest in the glimmering colours and mistier edges of objects derived from the Venetian painters, notably the works of Venetian oil painter Titian, which Annibale and Agostino studied during their travels around Italy in 1580-81 at the behest of the elder Caracci Lodovico. This eclecticism was to become the defining trait of the artists of the Baroque Emilian or Bolognese School.

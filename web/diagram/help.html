  <h1>Help page</h1>
  <p>Carracci is an application for creating and editing UML class diagrams</p>

  <h2>Anatomy</h2>

  <p>there are 3 main sections within the application:</p>

  <p>
    the <strong>navigation bar</strong> is the thin black rectangle at the top
    of the viewport spanning its width. currently, it contains only the help
    button
  </p>

  <p>
    the <strong>sidebar</strong> runs along the right hand side of the viewport.
    it contains the options menu
  </p>

  <p>
    the <strong>viewing pane</strong> is the largest within the application. it
    contains a diagram when one is loaded; otherwise it is empty
  </p>

  <h2>Editing a diagram</h2>

  <p>
    you can edit in a number of different ways: moving boxes around, adjust
    position of connectors, change line types, change arrow types and more
  </p>

  <h3>Diagram</h3>

  <p>
    when you first start the application, a diagram is already loaded into the
    viewing pane. you can delete it by clicking on
    <strong>delete diagram</strong> in the menu. you can now either create a new
    diagram, or else load one of the built-in diagrams
  </p>

  <p>
    if there is not a diagram currently loaded, click on
    <strong>diagram</strong> under the <strong>create</strong> section in the
    menu. a pop up will appear which asks you to give your diagram a name. do
    this and click Ok. a new diagram will be created, although the viewing pane
    will still be empty as no elements have been added
  </p>

  <h3>Type boxes</h3>

  <p>
    click on <strong>type box</strong> under the <strong>create</strong> section
    in the menu. a type box will appear somewhere within the viewing pane
  </p>

  <p>click and drag on a type box to move it around the viewing pane</p>

  <p>double-click on a type box to bring up a pop-up for editing it.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>edit name of type box</li>
    <li>toggle between a class and an interface</li>
    <li>add, edit, and delete properties</li>
    <li>add, edit, and delete methods</li>
    <li>add a note</li>
    <li>delete the type box</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Connectors</h3>

  <p>
    click on <strong>horizontal</strong> under the
    <strong>create</strong> section in the menu. a horizontal connector will
    appear somewhere within the viewing pane
  </p>

  <p>
    click on <strong>vertical</strong> under the <strong>create</strong> section
    in the menu. a vertical connector will appear somewhere within the viewing
    pane
  </p>

  <p>
    connectors, both horizontal and vertical flavours, consist of three lines
    drawn between 4 nodes. the nodes are invisible but can be thought of as
    circles existing at the meeting and end points of the three lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    you can click on a node and drag it around. this permits the shape of the
    connector of which it is a part to be altered.
  </p>

  <p>
    the node can only be moved within certain constraints. if a horizontal
    connector is connected to a type box, the two nodes closest the type box can
    only be moved vertically within the range of the top and bottom of the type
    box, and the node closest to the type box cannot be moved horizontally at
    all. similarly, for a vertical connector connected to a type box, the two
    nodes closest to the type box can only be moved horizontally within the
    range of the left and right edges of the type box, and the node closest to
    the type box cannot be moved vertically at all
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>double-click</b> on a node to bring up a popup that asks if you want to
    delete the connector. click <strong>delete</strong> to delete the connector
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>alt-click</b> on a node to toggle between a solid line and a dotted line
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>shift-alt-click</b> on an end node to change the kind of arrow. the
    different types are: open arrow, closed white arrow, white diamond, black
    diamond, and none
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>shift-click</b> on an end node that is not connected to a type box
    prepares it to be connected. shift-click on a type box to complete the
    connection (note: don't hold shift down whilst clicking on the node and the
    type box)
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>shift-click</b> on an end node that is connected to a type box to
    disconnect it from the type box
  </p>

  <h3>Banners</h3>

  <p>
    click on <strong>banner</strong> under the <strong>create</strong> section
    in the menu. a pop up will appear allowing you to give the banner a title,
    an author, a creation date, and contents. click <strong>save</strong> to
    create the banner
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>double-click</b> on the banner to bring up the pop up for further editing
  </p>

  <p></p>

  <h3>Built-in diagrams</h3>

  <p>
    the built-in diagrams demonstrate various design patterns. they exist as an
    example of what is possible within this application, as a starting point for
    your own diagrams, and as a tool for learning about design patterns. load
    one of these diagrams by clicking on its name on the menu within the
    <strong>load</strong> section
  </p>

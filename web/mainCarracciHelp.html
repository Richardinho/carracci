    <p>
        Carracci is a web application for creating and editing UML class diagrams. It consists of a viewer which contains t
        he current diagram, and a command line editor through which the user can
        type commands to manipulate a diagram. The user can also carry out some editing tasks directly on the diagram itself
        by dragging components and by using some keyboard shortcut style commands. Completed diagrams can be exported
        to PNG format. Other formats are being worked upon at the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to get up and running you can load into the viewer  a pre-existing diagram. Simply type the command 'load commandPattern' to see a diagram
        representing the Command Pattern.
        type commands 'max' and 'min' to maximise or minimise the command editor to it's largest and smallest size.

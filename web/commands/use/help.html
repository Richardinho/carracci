        navigate through the diagram's context tree. The diagram is arranged in a tree structure and all the artifacts of the diagram occupy different nodes of the
        tree. In order to edit or create an artifact it is necessary to be at the correct node of the context tree. The root node represents the diagram itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        navigation from the root downwards can only be done one level at a time. e.g. from the diagram down to a class box artifact. However when navigating in the opposite
        direction upwards towards the root it is possible to jump more than one level at a single step.
    </p>

    <h3 class="help-article__header--section">Examples</h3>
    <p>
        use diagram commandPattern
    </p>

    <p>
        Once a diagram has been loaded or created, this is the first command you need in order to set the context to the diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
        use type List
    </p>
    <p>
        When at the root of the tree (in diagram context) this command switches to the context of a particular type, in this case 'List'.
    </p>

    <p>
        use type

    </p>

    <p>
        Providing you are at a context node below the level of the artifact type (In this case if you were in method context) if you specify only the artifact type
        you will navigate up the context tree to the nearest node of this type.

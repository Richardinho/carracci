    <h4>Create</h4>

    <p>general command for creating all types of artifacts.</p>

    <h3>syntax</h3>

    <p>create ARTIFACT NAME | ARTIFACT_TYPE</p>

    <p>The create command takes the following forms:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>create diagram DIAGRAM_NAME            </li>
        <li>create type TYPE_NAME                  </li>
        <li>create connector CONNECTOR_ORIENTATION </li>
        <li>create property PROPERTY_NAME          </li>
        <li>create method METHOD_NAME              </li>
        <li>create arg ARG_NAME ARG_VALUE          </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For these commands to work the context path must be in the right state.
        As well as this, a diagram can only be created if there doesn't exist
        a current one.
    </p>

    <h3>connectors</h3>
    <p>
        Generally, the 2nd argument to the command is the name to give to the artifact.
        However, in the case of connectors, this argument must be one of two values:
        'horizontal' for horizontally aligned connectors (meaning that their ends point left or right),
        or 'vertical',(meaning that their ends point up or down).
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>
        To create a type called 'Foo': create type Foo
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a horizontally aligned connector: create connector horizontal
    </p>

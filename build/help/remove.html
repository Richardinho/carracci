    <h3>syntax</h3>

    <code>remove ARTIFACT_TYPE ARTIFACT_NAME</code>

    <p>
        This is a general command for removing artifacts both from the model and from the display. The various forms
        of the command corresponding to the artifacts for which it is used are listed below, with an explanation
        of these use cases further down.
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>remove diagram DIAGRAM_NAME</li>
        <li>remove type TYPE_NAME</li>
        <li>remove method METHOD_NAME</li>
        <li>remove property PROPERTY_NAME</li>
        <li>remove arg ARG_NAME</li>
        <li>remove connector CONNECTOR_ID</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>removing a diagram</h3>

    <p>
        This form of the command can be called regardless of the state
        of the context path. The diagram specified must refer to an existing diagram artifact. The context
        path will also be reset as a result of calling the command in this form.
    </p>

    <h3>removing a type</h3>
    <p>
        The context path must be at 'diagram' level. Also, the type specified must refer to
        an existing type artifact. An appropriate error message will be displayed if either of these conditions
        is not met.
    </p>

    <h3>removing a method</h3>
    <p>
        The context path must be at 'type' level. Also, the method specified must refer to
        an existing method artifact. An appropriate error message will be displayed if either of these conditions
        is not met.
    </p>

    <h3>removing a property</h3>
    <p>
        The context path must be at 'type' level. Also, the property specified must refer to
        an existing property artifact. An appropriate error message will be displayed if either of these conditions
        is not met.
    </p>

    <h3>removing an argument</h3>
    <p>
        The context path must be at 'method' level. Also, the argument specified must refer to
        an existing argument artifact. An appropriate error message will be displayed if either of these conditions
        is not met.
    </p>

    <h3>removing a connector</h3>
    <p>
        This context path must be at least at diagram level. It can be called at levels below this. The second argument
        specifies the artifact id for the connector. This id can be found by running the 'show' command and
        inspecting the json produced from that. An error message will be displayed if there is no corresponding
        connector artifact for this id.
    </p>

<h1>Welcome to Carracci</h1>
<h2>A web browser based Uml diagram editing tool with CL facilities</h2>
<p>
   Carracci is a web application for creating and editing UML class diagrams.
   It is unique in providing editing facilities through both an interactive graphical display
   and through an embedded command line editor.


   Uml class, interface, and abstract class boxes, as well as connectors, can easily be created and configured  from the command line editor.
    Once created, these components can be visually moved around by dragging and, for some commands, executing key and mouse combinations.
